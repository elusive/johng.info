# johng.info

## Overview
Landing page for my personal site. A minimal page to serve as a presence on the 
internet and to provide basic career information about me. Also to provide links
to any other content I wish to connect.

## Technology
This site is static, generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site generator.
Hosted using my github account due to the fact that there is almost zero traffic
to the site, meaning sub 100 hits per month.

If for some reason you wish to run the site locally as an example you can do so
by executing the following commands from a terminal prompt. This assumes you have
the prerequisites installed first.

### Prerequisites
1. Ruby v2.5 or higher
2. Jekyll gem
3. Bundler gem

```
git clone git@github.com:elusive/johng.info.git
cd johng.info
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open your web browser and navigate to: <http://localhost:4000> to view.
